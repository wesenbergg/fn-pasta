# Introduction to fn-pasta

fn-pasta is a collection of utility functions designed to be easily copied and pasted into your projects. Unlike traditional libraries that require installation through package managers, fn-pasta takes a different approach by providing standalone functions you can simply copy and use.

## Philosophy

The core philosophy behind fn-pasta is simplicity and independence:

- **No dependencies**: Each function is self-contained
- **Just copy what you need**: Use only the functions you need, no extra bloat
- **TypeScript ready**: All functions include type definitions
- **Well documented**: Clear examples and explanations

## How it works

1. Browse through the categorized functions
2. Read the documentation and examples
3. Click the copy button to copy the function code
4. Paste directly into your project
5. Use the function in your code!

## Benefits

- **Reduce package dependencies**: Fewer dependencies means simpler maintenance
- **Better understanding**: By copying the code, you understand exactly what's being used
- **Easy customization**: Modify the function to fit your specific needs
- **No version conflicts**: The function is part of your codebase, no worries about compatibility
